# Langton's Ant Kata

Inspired by a Coding Dojo at REWE digital, based on https://codingdojo.org/kata/LangtonAnt/

- Squares on a plane are colored either black or white.
- One square is the "ant".
- The ant can travel in four cardinal directions.
- The ant turns …
    - 90˚ right on a white square, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
    - 90˚ left on a black square, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
---

This kata will be implemented with [TDD as if You Meant It](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It/) and Inside Out TDD (Bottom Up/Chicago School/Classic Approach).

> Add a test, See it fail, Make all tests pass, Refactor, and Repeat until done.
